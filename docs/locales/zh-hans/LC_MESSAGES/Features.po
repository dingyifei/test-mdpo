msgid "Klipper has several compelling features:"
msgstr "Klipper 有几个引人注目的功能："

msgid ""
"High precision stepper movement. Klipper utilizes an application "
"processor (such as a low-cost Raspberry Pi) when calculating printer "
"movements. The application processor determines when to step each "
"stepper motor, it compresses those events, transmits them to the "
"micro-controller, and then the micro-controller executes each event "
"at the requested time. Each stepper event is scheduled with a "
"precision of 25 micro-seconds or better. The software does not use "
"kinematic estimations (such as the Bresenham algorithm) - instead it "
"calculates precise step times based on the physics of acceleration "
"and the physics of the machine kinematics. More precise stepper "
"movement translates to quieter and more stable printer operation."
msgstr ""
"高精度步进运动。Klipper使用一个应用处理器（例如低成本的树莓派）来计算打印机运动。应用处理器决定何时对每个步进电机发出步进信号，压缩这些事件，并将它们发送到微控制器。微处理器将会把每个事件按请求时间执行。每一个步进事件被以25毫秒或更高的精度安排。软件不进行运动估计，例如"
" Bresenham算法，而是通过加速度与机械运动物理计算精确的步进时间。更精准的步进电机运动意味着打印机更安静和稳定的运行。"

msgid ""
"Best in class performance. Klipper is able to achieve high stepping "
"rates on both new and old micro-controllers. Even old 8bit micro-"
"controllers can obtain rates over 175K steps per second. On more "
"recent micro-controllers, rates over 500K steps per second are "
"possible. Higher stepper rates enable higher print velocities. The "
"stepper event timing remains precise even at high speeds which "
"improves overall stability."
msgstr ""
"同类固件中最佳表现。 Klipper 能够在新的和旧的微控制器上实现高步进率。即使是旧的 8 位微控制器也可以获得超过每秒 175K "
"步的速率。在较新的微控制器上，速率可以超过每秒 500K "
"步。更高的步进速率可实现更高的打印速度。即使在高速下也能保持步进事件计时精确，从而提高整体稳定性。"

msgid ""
"Klipper supports printers with multiple micro-controllers. For "
"example, one micro-controller could be used to control an extruder, "
"while another controls the printer's heaters, while a third controls "
"the rest of the printer. The Klipper host software implements clock "
"synchronization to account for clock drift between micro-controllers."
" No special code is needed to enable multiple micro-controllers - it "
"just requires a few extra lines in the config file."
msgstr ""
"Klipper "
"支持带有多个微控制器的打印机。例如，一个微控制器可以被用来控制挤出机，而另一个用来控制加热器，并使用第三个来控制其他的打印机组件。Klipper"
" 主机程序实现了时钟同步，解决了微处理器之间的时钟漂移。 启用多个控制器只需要在配置文件中添加几行，不需要任何特殊代码。"

msgid ""
"Configuration via simple config file. There's no need to reflash the "
"micro-controller to change a setting. All of Klipper's configuration "
"is stored in a standard config file which can be easily edited. This "
"makes it easier to setup and maintain the hardware."
msgstr ""
"通过简单的配置文件进行配置。修改设置不需要重新刷写微控制器。Klipper "
"的所有配置都被存储在一个易编辑的配置文件中，大大减少了配置与维护硬件的难度。"

msgid ""
"Klipper supports \"Smooth Pressure Advance\" - a mechanism to account"
" for the effects of pressure within an extruder. This reduces "
"extruder \"ooze\" and improves the quality of print corners. "
"Klipper's implementation does not introduce instantaneous extruder "
"speed changes, which improves overall stability and robustness."
msgstr ""
"Klipper 支持“平滑提前压力”--一种考虑了挤出机内压力影响的机制。这项技术可以减少喷嘴溢料并改善转角的打印质量。Klipper "
"的实现不会引入瞬间挤出机速度变化，改善了整体稳定性和稳健性。"

"Klipper supports \"Input Shaping\" to reduce the impact of vibrations"
" on print quality. This can reduce or eliminate \"ringing\" (also "
"known as \"ghosting\", \"echoing\", or \"rippling\") in prints. It "
"may also allow one to obtain faster printing speeds while still "
"maintaining high print quality."
msgstr ""
"Klipper "
"支持使用“输入整形”来减少振动对打印质量的影响。这项功能可以减少或消除打印件的“振纹(ringing)”（又名“ghosting”，“echoing”，或“rippling”）。It"
" may also allow one to obtain faster printing speeds while still "
"maintaining high print quality."

"Klipper uses an \"iterative solver\" to calculate precise step times "
"from simple kinematic equations. This makes porting Klipper to new "
"types of robots easier and it keeps timing precise even with complex "
"kinematics (no \"line segmentation\" is needed)."
msgstr ""
"Klipper 使用“迭代求解器”从简单的运动学方程中计算精准的步进时间。This makes porting Klipper to "
"new types of robots easier and it keeps timing precise even with "
"complex kinematics (no \"line segmentation\" is needed)."

"Portable code. Klipper works on ARM, AVR, and PRU based micro-"
"controllers. Existing \"reprap\" style printers can run Klipper "
"without hardware modification - just add a Raspberry Pi. Klipper's "
"internal code layout makes it easier to support other micro-"
"controller architectures as well."
msgstr ""
"易移植的代码。Klipper 可以在 "
"ARM，AVR，和PRU架构的微控制器上运行。现有的“reprap”类打印机不需要改动任何硬件就可以运行 "
"Klipper，只需要加一个树莓派。Klipper 的内部代码结构使它能够被简单的移植到其他架构。"

msgid ""
"Simpler code. Klipper uses a very high level language (Python) for "
"most code. The kinematics algorithms, the G-code parsing, the heating"
" and thermistor algorithms, etc. are all written in Python. This "
"makes it easier to develop new functionality."
msgstr ""
"简洁的代码。大部分 Klipper "
"代码使用一个极高级编程语言（Python），这包括了运动算法，G代码解析，加热，温度传感器算法和其他，降低了开发新功能的难度。"

msgid ""
"Custom programmable macros. New G-Code commands can be defined in the"
" printer config file (no code changes are necessary). Those commands "
"are programmable - allowing them to produce different actions "
"depending on the state of the printer."
msgstr ""
"自定义可编程脚本。可以在打印机配置文件中定义新的G代码命令（而不需要修改任何代码）。这些命令都是可编程的，可以能根据打印机的状态做出不同的响应。"
