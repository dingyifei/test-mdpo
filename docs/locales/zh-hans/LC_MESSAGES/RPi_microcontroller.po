msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Often the MCUs dedicated to controlling 3D printers have a limited "
"and pre-configured number of exposed pins to manage the main printing"
" functions (thermal resistors, extruders, steppers ...). Using the "
"RPi where Klipper is installed as a secondary MCU gives the "
"possibility to directly use the GPIOs and the buses (i2c, spi) of the"
" RPi inside klipper without using Octoprint plugins (if used) or "
"external programs giving the ability to control everything within the"
" print GCODE."

"On Rasperry and on many clones the pins exposed on the GPIO belong to"

"which the exposed pins belong to gpiochips other than the first. For "
"example in the case of some OrangePi models or if a Port Expander is "
"used. In these cases it is useful to use the commands to access the "
